        <h2>Classic Neapolitan Pizza</h2>
            <p>Neapolitan pizza, or pizza Napoletana, is a type of pizza that originated in Naples, Italy. This style of pizza is prepared with simple and fresh ingredients: a basic dough, raw tomatoes, fresh mozzarella cheese, fresh basil and olive oil. <strong><em>No fancy toppings are allowed.</em></strong></p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Water</li>
                <li>Active Dry Yeast</li>
                <li>'00' Pizza Flour</li>
                <li>Salt</li>
                <li>Honey</li>
                <li>San Marzano Tomatoes</li>
                <li>Fresh Basil</li>
                <li>Mozzarella Cheese</li>
                <li>Extra Virgin Olive Oil</li>
            </ul>
        <h2>Steps to Prepare the Dish</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Place all water in the mixing bowl</li>
                    <p>For active yeast the water temp needs to be warm (the package says 100-110 degrees, but honestly anything between “lukewarm” and “very hot” will activate it without killing it). Inactive yeast doesn’t need to be activated by warm water and you can add it directly to your dry ingredients, but since we’re not adding all our dry ingredients at once in this recipe (see step 3) now is a good time to get the yeast in the mix</p>
                <li>Add Sugar/Honey and Mix Well</li>
                <li>Start Adding Flour</li>
                    <p>At this point I usually add about 25% and mix well. The mis should still be very watery.</p>
                <li>Add the Salt and Mix Well</li>
                    <p>The salt is added at this point for two reasons: 1) apparently salt can retard the growth of yeast if it makes direct contact with it, thus we add some flour first to act as a sort of buffer. I’ve seen some people suggest that at the concentrations of yeast and salt used in pizza dough this phenomenon doesn’t occur, but I haven’t wanted to put this claim to the test. And 2) we want the mix to still be wet so that the salt can dissolve. If we add the salt at the end, the dough is too dry to dissolve the salt and the salt remains in crystals, thus preventing it from helping strengthen the gluten network of the dough. 
                    </p>
                <li>Add the Rest of the Flour</li>
                <li>Resume Mixing</li>
                    <p>After a few minutes, add your oil. The oil is added <strong>last</strong> because otherwise it competes with water for hydration of the flour. We prefer to have our flour fully hydrated with water.</p>
                <li>Knead the dough and set it on the counter</li>
                    <p>At this point, your dough might be a little sticky/tacky and won't look very smooth. That's fine. <strong>Form a dough ball and let the dough sit covered by your mixing bowl or a damp cloth for 10 minutes.</strong>Alternatively, if you’re using a stand mixer and it’s done a good job at kneading the dough, you can just leave the dough in the bowl and cover the bowl with a damp cloth for 10 minutes. </p>
                <li>Perform a Stretch and Fold</li>
                    <p>Stretch and fold and reform your dough ball and place it back under the bowl/damp cloth for another ten minutes.</p>
                <li>Place Dough in Ball and Cover it</li>
                <li>Ball Your Dough</li>
                    <p>The timeframe for this next step probably doesn’t matter much. I’ve seen people say to limit the bulk ferment to 1 hour or 2 hours. I see more people suggest to let the dough bulk ferment the entire time and ball 4-6 hours before you intend to cook them (e.g., if we did a 24-hour room temperature ferment, we would let it bulk ferment for ~20 hours and ball them for the last ~4 hours. If you’re doing a 10-hour ferment, ferment in bulk for 6 hours and ball for the last 4. 6-hour ferment, bulk for 2 hours and ball for the last 4. You get the jist). 
                    </p>
                    <p>To ball your dough, take the dough and cut with a knife into small pieces. If you’re using a scale (highly recommended, by the way), then weigh the pieces out to whatever your intended serving size was in the Pizzapp. Otherwise, you can just divide the dough into X equal portions (when I aim for 230 grams, some balls are 210 grams, some are 240+. They all turn out fine). 
                    </p>
                    <p>It’s important to ball the dough correctly but it’s not hard to learn. When you ball it correctly, you create tension on the dough, which helps it both rise and relax appropriately. Here are some good videos demonstrating how to do this:
