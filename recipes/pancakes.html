        <h2>Classic Pancake Description</h2>
            <p>This is a great recipe that I found in my Grandma's recipe book. Judging from the weathered look of this recipe card, this was a family favorite.</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>All-Purpose Flour</li>
                <li>Baking Powder</li>
                <li>Salt</li>
                <li>White Sugar</li>
                <li>Milk</li>
                <li>Eggs</li>
                <li>Butter</li>
            </ul>
        <h2>How to Prepare the Dish</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Add the Dry and Wet Ingredients</li>
                    <p>In a large bowl, sift together the flour, baking powder, salt and sugar. Make a well in the center and pour in the milk, egg and melted butter; mix until smooth.</p>
                <li>Prepare the Griddle</li>
                    <p>Heat a lightly oiled griddle or frying pan over medium-high heat. Pour or scoop the batter onto the griddle, using approximately 1/4 cup for each pancake. Brown on both sides and serve hot.</p>
                
            </ol>
